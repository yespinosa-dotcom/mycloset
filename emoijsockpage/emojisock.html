            <p class="what">
                <strong>What:</strong> White long socks with some dumb ass emojis on it. I love these socks so much theyre so stupid and unserious. They have a crazy aura. I wore them to an interview once, and the guy I was interviewing was like "nice socks lol" and it totally broke the tension (I hired him).

            <p class="emotions">
                <strong>Emotions:</strong> Tbh these socks kinda make me sad. LMAO like total vibe switch and really ironic considering the selection of emojis on the socks. i really love these socks but im no longer close or really friends with the person who owns the matching pair. she was a close friend, wed been friends since elementary. the socks were our inside joke, we wore them the entire summer we got them. after the summer was up we just kinda stopped being friends and neither of us ever really addressed it. Mix of moving away, growing apart and some miscommunication. I kinda see her in some of my current friends. heh

            <p class="memories">
                <strong>Memories:</strong> My highschool friends' camping trip made it out of the groupchat! This was the first ever trip we took together and I remember having a really good time. It was already summer when we were trying to book a site, so all the spots in the popular spots like sequoia were gone. I came up on Bass lake which is in Fresno County, right under yosemite. It was an awesome site, but the vibes were pretty crazy. The entire town celebrated Trump's bday at the lake a week before we got there. Anyways so the whole trip felt like a fever dream, we met this guy who was super high the whole time who was camping next to our site, who was like super confused as to why we would ever come to bass lake. He gave us his egg rolls and beer. We found these socks at the gift store, and we knew we had to get them. It was the perfect item to commemorate the fever dream trip.

            <p class="feel">
                <strong>Feel:</strong> These are actually really nice quality, theyre thick and made of cotton. Ive worn them so many times therye starting to warp a little. When I first took off the tag I accidentally ripped a hole into the sock, but I fixed them w thread, and theyve held up very nicely.
