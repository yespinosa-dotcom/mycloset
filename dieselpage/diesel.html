                <strong>What:</strong> The coolest low-mid rise bootcut flare Diesel dark wash jeans with unique patchwork pattern. Probably the coolest pair of pants I own. Diesel is also my favorite brand—I really like their older stuff especially. I tried these on in 2021 when I was going through my aunt's clothes, but I didn't ask to see if I could have them because I couldn't see myself wearing them. She definitely would have said yes though. After I came back to America I fully regret not asking for these pants, and I literally became so obsessed with the concept of having these jeans in my possession that it would show up in my dreams. Finally 2 years later my mom brought them back for me, and my aunt told me to treat these pants like an heirloom. I wear these all the time!!! Even during summer in SoCal. You can dress these up or down.

                <strong>Feel:</strong> These jeans are super tight on, and everyday is lowkey a gamble to see if they still fit me. They can be pretty uncomfortable to wear, and if I wear a belt with these I get some nasty bruises on my hips for a few days. But they are so cool it's like kind of worth the loss of blood circulation sort of. Over the summer one of the seams fully ripped and I almost had a heart attack, but I was able to fix them and they've held up since.

                <strong>Memories:</strong> When I first started getting close to my friend Julie, she was always wearing the coolest outfits. Fashion was definitely something we related on, and these jeans remind me of that time. I thought she was incredibly sweet and genuine and cool. She would always point these out when I'd wear them and remember them as my Diesel jeans.
