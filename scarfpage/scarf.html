                <strong>A. Acquired:</strong> Fall 2022, Florence, Italy
            </p>

            <p class="what">
                <strong>B. What:</strong> Gray Cashmere scarf, made in nepal. This is a huge staple in my closet and I honestly wish I bought more. There was this nepali cashmere store in Florence right next to where my study abroad apartment was, and the lady there was moving back to her home country to take care of her newborn grand daughter, so she had a hugeee sale of these 100% quality cashmere pieces and vintage jewelry. I think to this day this is the greatest deal on some great clothes I've ever scored, I spent so much money there. In that sense I feel really proud of myself whenever I think about this sweater (bc i love a good bargain :p).

            <p class="memories">
                <strong>C. Memories:</strong> I have good memories attatched to this scarf. It reminds me of my study abroad trip. It also reminds me of what was essentially my first interaction w my friend calvin, he was super cold at this function we were both at so I let him borrow this scarf and that was the start of our friendship.

            <p class="feel">
                <strong>D. Feel:</strong> This scarf is really long and wide, and its perfect to wear as a shawl and can be worn casually or worn up. Its dark gray so it makes me feel put together. I take this with me whenever I go out, and it is super light and perfect as a cover up at night. Its been inspiring me to start a business surrounding this concept but I haven't gotten around to it. Many good things have come as a result of this scarf. It is also super soft. I love this scarf!!
