            <p class="acquired">
                <strong>Acquired:</strong> 2022-23 ish. Goodwill Bins- Glendale, California
            </p>

            <p class="what">
                <strong>What:</strong> I was searching for a pair of oversized vintage jeans during this time because I wanted pants that would give me a relaxed fit, and could also be styled to look masculine, androgynous or feminine. Super versatile. I found these in a bin and they were perfect. I was with my sister, and she was also really happy and she immediately was like, "lets share!" For a while I was wearing these a lot, but then I felt like they fit me weird, so I gave them to my sister. But then they were mine at one point, then hers, then mine again. It was both a competitive sibling ownership thing and also an accidental thing. 
            </p>

            <p class="memories">
                <strong>Memories:</strong> These remind me of my time at community college. I wore these a lot during that time. They went with everything. 
            </p>

            <p class="feel">
                <strong>Emotions/Feel:</strong> These perfectly sit on my waist, and I really like that. I don't really like that theyre light wash because its not a color I really like to reach for, and I also feel like its a little too causal for my taste. They are super comfortable and thick so I just don't feel like giving them up yet. The pockets are huge which is awesome, and theyre perfectly long. Its starting to fray pretty bad on the hem, they get stuck under my shoe and get kinda gross. I can't tell if they look good on me or not. Im back and forth on this every two years, I think twice now ive felt this and given them to my sister, but then asked for them back which makes her really mad. But ill never admit to remembering that I gave them to her. This time I got them back via a fair trade so theres no beef.
