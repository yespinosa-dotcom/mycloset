            <p class="what">
                <strong>What:</strong> Burgundy red thrifted London Fog Mens windbreaker jacket, super oversized. Pretty worn around the sleeves. There is always something in the pocket. For example, when I checked to take a picture of it today I found an old pack of gum.

            <p class="memories">
                <strong>Memories:</strong> This was coachella 2016 (2019). This was the era of big ol oversized vintage mens jackets, I loved this jacket sm and wore it ALLLL the time. It was literally perfect, like the perfect oversized fit and great for layering. London Fog makes really great jackets and this one had some pretty cool features like an inside pocket. Burgundy/Dark Cherry Red is also my favorite color! It was also one of my only jackets I owned and still is, which is why I still have it. I am also just a very sentimental person and feel weird about getting rid of it. I don't wear it because I feel like I was a different person during the time I wore the jacket, and it doesn't fit my wardrobe very much anymore. I brought it with me to UCLA because I kinda wanna bring it back. This jacket is really big on me. When I stopped wearing this jacket, Id let my ex bf who wore a mens size L borrow it p often which I thought was pretty funny, he was able to wear a lot of stuff from my closet bc id get a lot of stuff in that size.
