                <strong>Acquired:</strong> December 2021. Pomona, California.

            <p class="what">
                <strong>What:</strong> This top was originally a size M unisex black cotton t shirt. My dad got me this shirt (he will come up a lot during this project). We were at the 2021 Viva Pomona Fest, which is a festival organized by the Glass House in Pomona, and they always have a really good lineup of the next big indie artists + some really great up and coming local bands. For 35 bucks we got to see Eyedress, Magdalena Bay, Cowgirl Clue and Archer, Oh that year. It was the first concert I'd been to post Covid and it was really exciting! Before the show we got food and went to the record store right around the area (either right next to the venue or in Claremont) which is where we got the shirt. Rhino Records has been around for a really long time and it was both to support the business but also a gift that is exemplary of our shared love for music. I also got a pair of socks that I really liked but I lost them unfortunately. My dad and I go to shows together when we can! And I definitely got my taste in music from my dad. He was the one who me on to a lot of my favorite bands etc. like Radiohead and The Strokes, and he's always tapped in to rising bands, trends, and local happenings. #awesomedad

            <p class="feel">
                <strong>Feel:</strong> The graphic on this shirt is so cool. It has a lot of sentimental value. Despite this I never ever wore it!! I think it was the fit. In 2021 I was collecting a lot of clothes that had a more androgynous oversized fit, but I realized I didn't have enough flattering clothing items when I wanted to dress more feminine. I just never reached for it, but I didn't want to get rid of it especially because it was a meaningful gift from my dad. So over the summer (2025) like a week before moving back to UCLA, I turned this top into a tube top because I needed more of those, and now I wear it a lot more than before.
